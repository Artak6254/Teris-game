## Features
Random Tetrominoes: The game randomly generates different tetrominoes (Tetris shapes) that the player must arrange to fill rows.
Rotations and Movements: The player can rotate and move tetrominoes left, right, and down using the keyboard arrow keys.
Score System: The game tracks the player's score, which increases with each completed line. Clearing multiple lines at once yields higher scores.
Game Over State: The game ends when there is no space left for new tetrominoes to spawn, at which point the player is prompted to start a new game.
Restart Functionality: Pressing the ESC key allows the player to restart the game at any point.


## Controls
Arrow Keys:
Up: Rotate the tetromino.<br/>
Down: Move the tetromino down faster.
Left: Move the tetromino to the left.
Right: Move the tetromino to the right.
Space Bar: Instantly drop the tetromino to the bottom.
Escape: Restart the game.
